# Loan Fraud Detection System

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions face significant losses due to fraudulent loan applications.  
This project aims to build a machine learning system that identifies potentially fraudulent loan applications based on applicant and loan-related features.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (optional for UI)

## Dataset
- Tabular dataset containing applicant demographics, financial history, and loan details
- Includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent loan records
- Class imbalance handled during training

## Approach
1. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Engineering and Encoding
3. Handling Class Imbalance
4. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Results
- Improved reca
